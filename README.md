# HangMan-Game
# Named GET HOOKED!!
I wanted to take a different approach from the normal hangman with a stick figure hanging on a rope, so i photoshoped alot of different images to make it look like a villainous character from the Anime Naruto. The background is actual a canvas with a width and height of the screen and also a z-index of -1. I also created circles on the canvas using context.arc method and animated them to randomly pop up at different parts of the Canvas then incremented its velocity by 1px/-1px for both the x and y axis and set it's radius to increase when the mouse is within 50px of its surrounding.
